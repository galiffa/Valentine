# Valentine Card Site

This is a single-page Valentine’s Day card website.

## Quick start (local)
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public or private).
2. From this folder, run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "valentine card"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Source = `Deploy from a branch`, Branch = `main`, Folder = `/ (root)`.
4. Your site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`

If you want, tell me your GitHub username and repo name and I can tailor the exact commands.
